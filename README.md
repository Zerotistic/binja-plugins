# Interactive Binja Plugin List

*Note: this is heavily inspired by [ida-plugins](https://github.com/vmallet/ida-plugins) from vmallet*

This is a comprehensive list of plugins for Binary Ninja that is more interactive, that is, it can be sorted and filtered to help with finding plugins of interest. It also has extra metadata like the language the plugin is written in and an attempt at putting plugins into categories.

[Go to the interactive list](http://zerotistic.github.io/).

## Contribute!

Any contribution is welcome one way or another. If you know of a plugin that could be added, or data in the list that could be updated, missing categories, typos... please send a PR! If you'd just prefer sending me a message over Discord: `zerotistic`.
